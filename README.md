# Three.js Journey ðŸš€

A collection of projects and exercises from the **Three.js Journey** course by Bruno Simon. This repository documents my progress through web 3D development, from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques.

## About This Repository

This repository contains hands-on implementations of Three.js concepts, organized by course progression. Each project demonstrates practical applications of 3D graphics, shaders, and interactive visualizations using WebGL.

## Course Progress

- [ ] Basics
- [ ] Classic Techniques
- [ ] Advanced Techniques
- [ ] Shaders
- [ ] Extra

**Note:** Live demos are available for all exercises from Classic Techniques onwards. Projects from Basics run locally with `npm run dev`.

## Quick Start

Each project is self-contained with its own dependencies:

```bash
cd project-folder
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server will start, and you can view the project in your browser.

## Resources

- **Course**: [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) by Bruno Simon
- **Documentation**: [Three.js Official Docs](https://threejs.org/docs/)
- **Examples**: [Three.js Examples Collection](https://threejs.org/examples/)

## Key Topics Covered

Throughout this course, I'm learning:
- Scene setup and camera configuration
- Geometries, materials, and lighting
- Textures and UV mapping
- 3D transformations and animations
- Custom shaders and GLSL
- Performance optimization techniques
- Interactive 3D experiences

## Notes

Insights, challenges, and key learnings for each concept are documented within individual project folders. This repository serves as both a learning journal and a reference for future Three.js development.
